  desc "Making certain that the web server has not been updated by an
  unauthorized user is always a concern. Adding patches, functions, and modules
  that are untested and not part of the baseline opens the possibility for
  security risks. The web server must offer, and not hinder, a method that allows
  for the quick and easy reinstallation of a verified and patched baseline to
  guarantee the production web server is up-to-date and has not been modified to
  add functionality or expose security risks.

    When the web server does not offer a method to roll back to a clean
  baseline, external methods, such as a baseline snapshot or virtualizing the web
  server, can be used.
