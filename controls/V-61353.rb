  desc  "During the initial setup of a Transport Layer Security (TLS)
connection to the web server, the client sends a list of supported cipher
suites in order of preference.  The web server will reply with the cipher suite
it will use for communication from the client list.  If an attacker can
intercept the submission of cipher suites to the web server and place, as the
preferred cipher suite, a weak export suite, the encryption used for the
session becomes easy for the attacker to break, often within minutes to hours."

  Review the web server documentation and deployed configuration to determine
  if export ciphers are removed.

  If NGINX is not configured to serve files, this check is Not Applicable.

    Check for the following:

    # grep the 'ssl_prefer_server_cipher' directive in each server context of
    the nginx.conf and any separated include configuration file.

  Verify that the 'ssl_prefer_server_cipher' directive is set to 'on'.
  If the directive is not set to 'on', this is a finding.

    # grep the 'ssl_ciphers' directive in each server context of the nginx.conf
    and any separated include configuration file.

  If the 'ssl_ciphers' directive is configured to include any export ciphers,
  this is a finding.

  If the 'ssl_prefer_server_cipher' and 'ssl_ciphers' directives cannot be found
  in NGINX configuration files, this check is Not Applicable.
