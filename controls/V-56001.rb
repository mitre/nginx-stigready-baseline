  title "The NGINX web server must employ cryptographic mechanisms (TLS/DTLS/SSL)
preventing the unauthorized disclosure of information during transmission."
  desc  "Preventing the disclosure of transmitted information requires that the
web server take measures to employ some form of cryptographic mechanism in
order to protect the information during transmission. This is usually achieved
through the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS).

    Transmission of data can take place between the web server and a large
number of devices/applications external to the web server. Examples are a web
client used by a user, a backend database, an audit server, or other web
servers in a web cluster.

    If data is transmitted unencrypted, the data then becomes vulnerable to
disclosure. The disclosure may reveal user identifier/password combinations,
website code revealing business logic, or other user personal information.
  "

  desc 'check', "Review the NGINX web server documentation and deployed configuration
  to determine whether the transmission of data between the web server and external
  devices is encrypted.

  If NGINX is not configured to serve files, this check is Not Applicable.

  Check if SSL is enabled on the server:
  #grep the 'listen' directive in the server context of the nginx.conf and any
  separated include configuration file.

  If the 'listen' directive is not configured to use ssl, this is a finding.

  Check for if 'ssl_protocols' is configured:
    #grep the 'ssl_protocols' directive in the server context of the nginx.conf and
    any separated include configuration file.

  If the 'ssl_protocols' directive is not set to the approved TLS version, this is a finding.

  If the 'listen' and 'ssl_protocols' directives cannot be found in NGINX configuration files,
  this check is Not Applicable.
  "

  Add the 'ssl_protocols' directive to the NGINX configuration file(s)
  and configure it to use the approved TLS protocols to ensure that all information
  in transmission is being encrypted.

  Example:
    server {
            listen 443 ssl;
            ssl_protocols TLSv1.2;
