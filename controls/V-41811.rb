  desc "Determining a safe state for failure and weighing that against a
  potential DoS for users depends on what type of application the web server is
  hosting. For an application presenting publicly available information that is
  not critical, a safe state for failure might be to shut down for any type of
  failure; but for an application that presents critical and timely information,
  a shutdown might not be the best state for all failures.

  configuring the web server according to what actions to take for each failure
  condition will provide a known fail safe state for the web server.
