  server at the lower levels of the OSI model, running unneeded utilities and
  programs is also a danger at the application layer of the OSI model. Office
  suites, development tools, and graphical editors are examples of such programs
  that are troublesome.

    Individual productivity tools have no legitimate place or use on an
  enterprise, production web server and they are also prone to their own security
  risks. The web server installation process must provide options allowing the
  installer to choose which utility programs, services, and modules are to be
  installed or removed. By having a process for installation and removal, the web
  server is guaranteed to be in a more stable and secure state than if these
  services and programs were installed and removed manually.

  configuration to determine which web server utilities, services, and modules
  are installed. Verify these options are essential to the operation of the
  web server. Also, confirm the web server install process offers an option to
  exclude these utilities, services, and modules from installation that are not
  needed for operation and that there is an uninstall option for their removal.

  Enter the following command to get a list of the modules installed:
    # nginx -V

  If there are more modules installed than are needed for the operation of
