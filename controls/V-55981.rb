installation, upgrades to the web server or modules, and security parameter
changes. With each of these changes, there is the potential for an adverse
effect such as a DoS, web server instability, or hosted application instability.

    To limit changes to the web server and limit exposure to any adverse
effects from the changes, files such as the web server application files,

properly to only allow privileged users access.

  this check is Not Applicable.

  is Not Applicable.

  This check verifies that the SA or Web Manager controlled account owns the key
  web server files. These same files, which control the configuration of the web
  server, and thus its behavior, must also be accessible by the account that runs
  the web service process.

  If it exists, the following file need to be owned by a privileged account:
    - nginx.conf and its included configuration files
    - Application directories

  Use the following commands:
    #  find / -name nginx.conf to find the file.
    #  grep 'include' on the nginx.conf file to identify included configuration files.

  Change to the directories that contain the nginx.conf and included configuration files.
  Use the following command:
    #   ls -l on these files to determine ownership of the file

  Use the following commands:
    #  grep 'root' on the nginx.conf file and any separate included configuration files
    to identify all the document root directories.
    # ls -l on all document root directories found to determine the ownership of directories

  -The Web Manager or the SA should own all the system files and directories.
  -The configurable directories can be owned by the WebManager or equivalent user.
      -Permissions on these files should be 660 or more restrictive.

  If root or an authorized user does not own the web system files and directories, and the
  permission are not correct, this is a finding.
