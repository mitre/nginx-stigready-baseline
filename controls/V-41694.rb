  Execute the following command:

  # nginx -V

  Verify the ‘nginx_http_proxy_module’ module is not installed.

    # grep the 'proxy_pass' directive in the location context of the nginx.conf and any

  If the 'nginx_http_proxy_module' module is installed and the 'proxy_pass' directive exists,
  this is a finding.

  Use the configure script (available in the nginx download package) to exclude the
  'nginx_http_proxy_module' module by using the --without {module_name} option.

  Ensure the 'proxy_pass' directive is not enabled in the NGINX configuration file(s).
