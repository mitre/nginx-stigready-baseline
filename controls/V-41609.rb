  execute on behalf of the user.

    The web server must be capable of enabling a setting for troubleshooting,
  debugging, or forensic gathering purposes which will log all user session
  information related to the hosted application session. Without the capability

  Review the NGINX web server documentation and deployed configuration to determine

  If there are no websites configured for NGINX, this check is Not Applicable.

  Check for the following:
    #grep the 'log_format' directive in the http context of the nginx.conf.

  If the the 'log_format' does not include the '$remote_user' variable, this is a finding.
