  this check is Not Applicable.

  Check for the following:
  #grep 'ssl_client_certifcate' directive in the http and server context of the
  nginx.conf file and any separated include configuration file.

  If the 'ssl_client_certifcate' directive cannot be found in NGINX configuration files,

  to an approved DoD CA, this is a finding.
