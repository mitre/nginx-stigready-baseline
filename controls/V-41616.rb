  analysis. Without sufficient and accurate information, a correct replay of the
  events cannot be determined.

    Ascertaining the correct source, e.g. source IP, of the events is important
  during forensic analysis. Correctly determining the source of events will add
  information to the overall reconstruction of the logable event. By determining
  the source of the event correctly, analysis of the enterprise can be undertaken
  to determine if events tied to the source occurred in other areas within the
  enterprise.

    A web server behind a load balancer or proxy server, when not configured
  correctly, will record the load balancer or proxy server as the source of every
  logable event. When looking at the information forensically, this information
  is not helpful in the investigation of events. The web server must record with
  each event the client source of the event.
