roles can be developed that can then be used to administer the web server.
Forcing users to change from a non-privileged account to a privileged account
when operating on the web server or on security-relevant information forces
users to only operate as a web server administrator when necessary. Operating
in this manner allows for better logging of changes and better forensic
information and limits accidental changes to the web server."

  This check verifies that the SA or Web Manager controlled account owns the key
  web server files. These same files, which control the configuration of the web
  server, and thus its behavior, must also be accessible by the account that runs
  the web service process.

  If it exists, the following file need to be owned by a privileged account:
    - nginx.conf and its included configuration files

  Use the following commands:
    #  find / -name nginx.conf to find the file.
    #  grep 'include' on the nginx.conf file to identify included configuration files.

  Change to the directories that contain the nginx.conf and included configuration files.
  Use the following command:
    #   ls -l on these files to determine ownership of the file

  -The Web Manager or the SA should own all the system files and directories.
  -The configurable directories can be owned by the WebManager or equivalent user.
  -Permissions on these files should be 660 or more restrictive.

  If root or an authorized user does not own the web system files and the permission are
  not correct, this is a finding.
