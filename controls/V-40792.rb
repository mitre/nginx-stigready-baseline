  desc  "Session management is the practice of protecting the bulk of the user
  authorization and identity information. Storing of this data can occur on the
  client system or on the server.

    When the session information is stored on the client, the session ID, along
  with the user authorization and identity information, is sent along with each
  client request and is stored in either a cookie, embedded in the uniform
  resource locator (URL), or placed in a hidden field on the displayed form. Each
  of these offers advantages and disadvantages. The biggest disadvantage to all
  three is the hijacking of a session along with all of the user's credentials.

    When the user authorization and identity information is stored on the
  server in a protected and encrypted database, the communication between the
  client and web server will only send the session identifier, and the server can
  then retrieve user credentials for the session when needed. If, during
  transmission, the session were to be hijacked, the user's credentials would not
  be compromised.
