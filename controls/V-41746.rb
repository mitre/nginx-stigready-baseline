  desc "Encryption is only as good as the encryption modules utilized.
  Unapproved cryptographic module algorithms cannot be verified and cannot be
  relied upon to provide confidentiality or integrity, and DoD data may be
  compromised due to weak algorithms.

    FIPS 140-2 is the current standard for validating cryptographic modules and
  NSA Type-X (where X=1, 2, 3, 4) products are NSA-certified, hardware-based
  encryption modules.

    The web server must provide FIPS-compliant encryption modules when
  authenticating users and processes.

  desc 'check', "
  Review NGINX web server documentation and deployed configuration to determine
  whether the encryption modules utilized for authentication are FIPS 140-2
  compliant.  Reference the following NIST site to identify validated encryption
  modules: http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/140val-all.htm

  If NGINX is not configured to serve files, this check is Not Applicable.

  Check for the following:
    #grep the 'ssl_protocols' directive in the server context of the nginx.conf
    and any separated include configuration file.

  If the 'ssl_protocols' directive cannot be found in NGINX configuration files,
  this check is Not Applicable.

  If the 'ssl_protocols' directive is not set to the FIPS comliant TLS versions,
  this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "Add the 'ssl_protocols' directive to the NGINX configuration file(s)

  Example:
  server {
