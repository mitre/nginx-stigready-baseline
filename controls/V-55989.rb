  desc "User management and authentication can be an essential part of any
  application hosted by the web server. Along with authenticating users, the user
  management function must perform several other tasks like password complexity,
  locking users after a configurable number of failed logins, and management of
  temporary and emergency accounts; and all of this must be done enterprise-wide.

    The web server contains a minimal user management function, but the web
  server user management function does not offer enterprise-wide user management,
  and user management is not the primary function of the web server. User
  management for the hosted applications should be done through a facility that
  is built for enterprise-wide user management, like LDAP and Active Directory.

  # grep 'auth_basic' and 'auth_basic_user_file' directive in the http, server,
