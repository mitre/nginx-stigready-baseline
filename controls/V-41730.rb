  certificate to a trusted root certification authority (CA). Certification path
  validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed decision
  regarding acceptance of an end entity certificate. Certification path
  validation includes checks such as certificate issuer trust, time validity and
  revocation status for each certificate in the certification path. Revocation
  status information for CA and subject certificates in a certification path is
  commonly provided via certificate revocation lists (CRLs) or online certificate
  status protocol (OCSP) responses."

  If NGINX is not configured to serve files, this check is Not Applicable.

  Check for the following:
    # grep the 'ssl_verify_client' and 'ssl_verify_depth' directives in the server
    context of the nginx.conf and any separated include configuration file.
