is to cause a DoS, and the second is to put in place changes the attacker made
to the web server configuration.

    To prohibit an attacker from stopping the web server, the process ID (pid)
of the web server and the utilities used to start/stop the web server must be
protected from access by non-privileged users. By knowing the pid and having
access to the web server utilities, a non-privileged user has a greater
capability of stopping the server, whether intentionally or unintentionally.
