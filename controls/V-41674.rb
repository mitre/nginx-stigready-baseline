  desc "Protection of log data includes assuring log data is not accidentally
  lost or deleted. Backing up log records to an unrelated system or onto separate
  media than the system the web server is actually running on helps to assure
  that, in the event of a catastrophic system failure, the log records will be
  retained."

  desc 'check', "
  Review the NGINX web server documentation and deployed configuration to determine
  if the web server log records are backed up onto an unrelated system or media
  than the system being logged.

  Interview the Information System Security Officer, System Administrator, Web Manager,
  Webmaster, or developers as necessary to determine whether a tested and verifiable
  backup strategy has been implemented for web server software and all web server
  data files.

  Proposed questions:
  - Who maintains the backup and recovery procedures?
  - Do you have a copy of the backup and recovery procedures?
  - Where is the off-site backup location?
  - Is the contingency plan documented?
  - When was the last time the contingency plan was tested?
  - Are the test dates and results documented?

  If there is not a backup and recovery process for the web server, this is a finding.
