  management IP address, the web server will also accept connections on the
  management IP address.

  If NGINX is not configured to serve files, this check is Not Applicable.

  Check for the following:
    # grep the 'listen' directive in the server context of the nginx.conf and any
    separated include configuration file.

  If the 'listen' directive cannot be found in NGINX configuration files,
  this check is Not Applicable.

  Verify that any enabled 'listen' directives specify both an IP address and

  If the 'listen' directive is found with only an IP address or only a port number
  specified, this is finding.

  If the IP address is all zeros (i.e., 0.0.0.0:80 or [::ffff:0.0.0.0]:80),
  this is a finding.
