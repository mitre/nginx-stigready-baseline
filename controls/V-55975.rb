is at risk of failing to process logs as required. Log processing failures
include: software/hardware errors, failures in the log capturing mechanisms,
and log storage capacity being reached or exceeded.

    If log capacity were to be exceeded, then events subsequently occurring
would not be recorded. Organizations shall define a maximum allowable
percentage of storage capacity serving as an alarming threshold (e.g., web
server has exceeded 75% of log storage capacity allocated), at which time the
web server or the logging mechanism the web server utilizes will provide a
warning to the ISSO and SA at a minimum.

    This requirement can be met by configuring the web server to utilize a
dedicated log tool that meets this requirement.
